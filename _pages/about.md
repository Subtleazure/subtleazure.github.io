I am a second year undergraduate student from [School of Computer Science](https://cs.whu.edu.cn/), [Wuhan University](www.whu.edu.cn). My research interest includes Federated Learning, Machine Learning, Computer Vision, etc.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Ye](https://marswhu.github.io/index.html) of MARS Lab. Currently, I am doing may research with my labmates, looking forward to writing a paper accepted by nips.
